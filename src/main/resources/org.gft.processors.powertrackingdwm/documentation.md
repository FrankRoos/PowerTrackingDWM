## Description
This processor computes daily , seven day and monthly Energy consumption, based on the given instantaneous powers and timestamps values that are transmitted as fields from events.

***

## Required input
Input event requires to have power and timestamp values.

***

## Configuration
### Instantaneous Power
The field containing the power value as a double in Kilowatt (kW).
### Timestamp
The field containing the time value (in millisecond) at which the power was taken.
### Waiting Time
The field containing the period or time value (in minute as a double) after which an output will be computed.

***

## Output
The Power Tracking processor appends the calculated power as a double in Kilowatt-hour (kWh).
